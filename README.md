# Problem Statement

During pandemic, many people have stopped using public transport for safety measures and have shifted to personal vehicles. There has been a significant rise in demand for used vehicles and with the evolving post-pandemic market scenario it is hard to predict viable prices of used vehicles. The present market is quite spread out, due to which it is hard for a user to find the right price and the right place to buy a used vehicle.

# Objective

The given dataset from vehicle provides us with the following information:
1. Name
2. Company
3. Year
4. Kms_driven
5. Fuel_type
6. Platform
<br>
Using the following dataset, we will be predicting the price of the used car by implementing a suitable model.

# Data Used 

The excel file with the data has been taken from the website Kaggle. Then we have changed the dataset by adding platform attribute.

# Predicted Output

The Car Price Prediction System predicts the price of the car with the given input by the user. We trained our dataset from the past and applied it to models which are based on Linear Regression. The algorithm will generate the most suitable price for the used car across multiple platforms.
